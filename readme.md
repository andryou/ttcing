# TTCing
You can say this is a reincarnation of TTCupdates.com (by Brian Gilham), because it is. TTCing aims to increase awareness of the current state of TTC services, be it positive or negative, by bringing the "conversation" directly you: conversations about delays on the subway, shuttle buses, or an awesome on-time streetcar. An informed rider is a happy rider. TTCing is and will always be a free service.

TTCing is based on TTCupdates with several new features and tweaks (the biggest one is that TTCing is not limited to just the "#ttcu" hashtag, it will pick up any tweet that has "ttc" or "#ttcu"; behind-the-scenes, TTCing includes tweet scoring algorithm, mood-detection, and route/station/bus number/stop-detection, and duplication checks).

## Note
Only the major components of TTCing are in this project (the algorithms and the update script).

## Features
* Includes tweets from the community
* Has a magical scoring algorithm that will share more meaningful tweets
* [Twitter] Credit given to original author by adding their name to the end of the tweet
* [Site] Number of new tweets (if any) shown in the window title (e.g. "(4) TTCing")
* [Site] Ability to filter through latest tweets based on various criteria
* Lots of amazing behind-the-scenes magic.
